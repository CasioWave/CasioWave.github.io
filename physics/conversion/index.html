    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Barchan dunes, characterized by their crescent-shaped morphology and
unidirectional movement, are a common feature in arid and semi-arid
regions. These dunes are formed by the action of wind on loose, dry sand
and are typically oriented with their convex side facing upwind.
Understanding the behavior of barchan dunes is crucial for a variety of
scientific and practical reasons, including the study of desertification
processes, the planning of infrastructure in desert areas, and the
interpretation of extraterrestrial landscapes such as those found on
Mars.</p>
<p>This report details the findings of a summer research project focused on
the dynamics of barchan dunes and their interaction with obstacles. The
primary objective of this study was to investigate how obstacles of
various sizes and shapes influence the movement, shape, and stability of
barchan dunes. By simulating different scenarios in both a computational
as well as experimental setting, the research intends to shed light on
the behavior of these dunes.</p>
<p>The research was conducted using a combination of researching field
observations, laboratory experiments, and numerical modeling. Field
observations provided baseline data on dune morphology and movement
patterns, while laboratory experiments allowed for the controlled
manipulation of variables such as wind speed, sand grain size, and
obstacle characteristics. Numerical models were employed to simulate
dune dynamics over longer timescales and to predict the potential
impacts of various environmental changes. This was combined with a study
of computational fluid dynamics so that the behavior of the dunes in
interaction with obstacles could be modeled more realistically.</p>
<p>Key questions addressed in this research include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can barchan dunes be reproduced experimentally in a lab setting?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can the experimental apparatus be designed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the experiment be designed and carried out?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can barchan dunes and their interactions with obstacles be
numerically simulated?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can the complexities of barchan dynamics be represented in a
simple numerical model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the change in the flow around obstacles and its effect
on barchans be simulated numerically?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections, we present a comprehensive overview of the
methodologies employed, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn
from this summer research project on barchan dunes and their
interactions with obstacles.</p>
<h1 id="experiment">Experiment</h1>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To reproduce barchan dunes on a small length scale in an
experimental setting.</p>
<h2 id="design-of-the-experimental-apparatus">Design of the experimental apparatus</h2>
<p>The primary conditions that need to be reproduced were -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unidirectional apparent wind direction above the threshold for grain
entrainment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control over the wind velocity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoidance of secondary flows that can deform the barchan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This was required because Barchans are primarily formed due to two
processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Saltation</strong>: The entrainment of sand grains into the air by the
action of wind flow - essentially flinging the sand from its initial
resting place to a certain distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avalanching</strong>: The process by which sand that is at a resting
angle that is greater than the angle of repose slides and deposits
itself further downstream until the angle of repose is reached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, as referenced in
<a href="#hersen_relevant_2002">[hersen_relevant_2002]</a>{.ref}, the distance
that is traveled by a saltated grain ($l_{d}$) is related to the mean
density of the grain ($\rho_{s}$), the density of the fluid flowing over
the sand bed ($\rho_{f}$), and the diameter of the grain ($d$) by the
equation:</p>
<p>$l_{d} = \frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{f}}d$</p>
<p>So if we can reduce the relative density of the sand grain concerning
the fluid ($\frac{\rho_{s}}{\rho_{f}}$), and use sand of a finer
diameter, we can reproduce the normally huge barchans on a much smaller,
centimeter-order, lengthscale. It is due to this that we take two
important decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Water would be the fluid of choice</strong>. We could have used denser
fluids, but they would be too difficult to procure and manage in the
apparatus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sand would be <strong>102 micron Silicon Carbide</strong>. It is easy to
procure and there is literature on the specific cohesive effects
between silicon carbide sand grains
(<a href="#preudhomme_effect_nodate">[preudhomme_effect_nodate]</a>{.ref}).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An interesting feature to note here is that Barchans are essentially
scale-invariant structures and occur at all length scales and
timescales.</strong> (Though there is some evidence to suggest that this might
not be the case, namely -
<a href="#kroy_comment_2004">[kroy_comment_2004]</a>{.ref}).<br>
In <a href="#hersen_relevant_2002">[hersen_relevant_2002]</a>{.ref}, they
reproduced Barchans on a small scale in subaqueous conditions using a
submerged plate that was subjected to asymmetrical vibrations such that
one direction of vibration was above the threshold of sand entrainment
and the other was under the threshold. This gives us strong evidence
that stable Barchans can be reproduced on centimeter-order lengthscales.</p>
<h3 id="initial-designs">Initial designs</h3>
<p>Several options were considered for the experimental apparatus that
could reproduce these conditions. A few of them are represented below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
<li>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
</ol>
<p>These designs were later rejected due to them being difficult to
water-seal, or due to the unpredictable turbulence of the flow through
them. A more elegant solution was sought that would not face such
difficulties and could utilize a rheometer that was available in the lab
to control the flow.</p>
<h3 id="final-design">Final design</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><br>
In <a href="#bacik_dynamics_2021">[bacik_dynamics_2021]</a>{.ref}, they used a
circular flume that is 97cm(outer radius) and with a flume width of 9
cm, to reproduce two-dimensional Barchan dunes. Other experiments
<a href="#alvarez_birth_2017">[alvarez_birth_2017]</a>{.ref}, have reproduced 3D
Barchan dunes using pressure-driven path flow. We sought to reproduce
these 3D Barchans using the flume apparatus instead of the
pressure-driven flow apparatus due to the reasons outlined above.<br>
We also chose to use 102-micron silicon carbide sand and did not use a
diameter that was lower due to cohesive effects that were warned of in
<a href="#hersen_relevant_2002">[hersen_relevant_2002]</a>{.ref} in sand that is
below 100 microns in diameter.<br>
The experimental apparatus that we designed consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a circular flume with outer radius of 15 cm and an inner radius of
11 cm with straight walls that are 8 cm high</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an angled paddle that could provide constant shear to the fluid
filling the channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support ring and disc to ensure that the walls are perfectly
straight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attachment for the paddle to the rheometer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The channel width is 4 cm which gives us a width-to-radius ratio of
0.26, which is &lt;&lt; 1, so we can reasonably expect an approximately
local straight flow in the channel on the order of length of the
Barchans. The base of the flume was made using a 0.7 cm thick acrylic
plate that was laser-cut to the specific dimensions. The walls of the
flume were constructed out of OHP sheets that provided transparency for
imaging the channel and were rigid enough to hold the water inside the
flume without warping.\</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><br>
The paddle was designed with inspiration from cone-and-plate viscometers
that are used to measure the rheological properties of minute samples.
The angled paddle in the cone-and-plate viscometer provides a constant
shear to the fluid. We sought to do the same with our paddle in order to
avoid complicated secondary flow problems during the spin-up of the
apparatus.<br>
This was created by laser cutting angled (20-degree) support structures
(as depicted in the figure above) and attaching a smooth strip of OHP
sheet on the angled face. This prevented edge effects from sharp paddle
edges in the fluid during rotation.<br>
The paddle apparatus would be attached to the rheometer along its
central axis. The rheometer would rotate the paddle apparatus at a
constant angular velocity. After the spin-up period, the fluid in the
flume would also be rotating at this angular velocity. The rheometer
would be run in a constant shear mode which adjusts the shear rate to
keep the angular velocity constant despite friction from the flume
walls.<br>
The sand would be deposited at the bottom of the flume in a conical heap
and after the spin-up, it is expected that it would gradually evolve
into a Barchan. All obstacles would also be similarly placed at the base
of the flume channel.\</p>
<h3 id="secondary-flow-problem">Secondary flow problem</h3>
<p>According to
<a href="#kolesnik_thomsoneinsteins_2023">[kolesnik_thomsoneinsteins_2023]</a>{.ref},
the Einstein tea leaves paradox poses a problem in our experimental
setup. This problem can be demonstrated by the simple swirling of tea
leaves to the center of a stirred cup of tea.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Similar to the setup of the paradox, the water in the flume is a
rotating body of fluid in contact with the walls of the container that
provide friction. Though the frictional effect of the outer flume
surface is countered by the inner flume surface, the effect of the base
plate friction is not countered by anything in the setup. This could
cause a secondary flow in the inward direction, which could potentially
deform the shape of the barchan (as perfect barchans are formed under
unidirectional wind flow parallel to their direction of propagation).
Several measures were considered to counterract this effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Non-moving lid with a sliding seal that could counterract the effect
of the base plate friction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filling the flume with straws to ensure that the flow is in the
direction that we desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding a counter-rotation to the base plate to counteract the
effects that cause the secondary flow. (The authors of
<a href="#bacik_dynamics_2021">[bacik_dynamics_2021]</a>{.ref} do this)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, in discussion with my guide, we arrived at the following
conclusions regarding this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The secondary flow is not going to be of an order that will skew
results in our experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The addition of lids and straws might cause other secondary flows in
our system, causing more hinderances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we decided to forgo correcting for the secondary flow in our
apparatus.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-1">Experiment</h2>
<p>The experiment could not be conducted due to problems with the
experimental apparatus construction, and due to a lack of time.</p>
<h1 id="simulation">Simulation</h1>
<p>The simulation work was started after taking inspiration from
<a href="#katsuki_emergence_2005">[katsuki_emergence_2005]</a>{.ref} and
<a href="#katsuki_cellular_2011">[katsuki_cellular_2011]</a>{.ref}, both of whose
work deals with numerically simulating the behavior of sand fields under
simple unidirectional wind flow, eventually obtaining barchans. This led
us to <a href="#werner_eolian_1995">[werner_eolian_1995]</a>{.ref} which was the
first paper that established numerical simulations of barchans.</p>
<h2 id="werner-cellular-automata-model">Werner Cellular Automata model</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The model put forward by
<a href="#werner_eolian_1995">[werner_eolian_1995]</a>{.ref} is essentially a
simple cellular automata simulation with the following rules specified:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sand field is comprised of cells $(x,y)$, each of which has an
assigned height of sand ($h_{x,y}$).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sand casts a shadow in the downstream (concerning the wind flow)
direction, decided by some fixed angle, approximating the extent of
a recirculation cell downwind of a slipface of a dune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cells are said to be in the shadow if it is the shadow of some cell
that is upwind of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sand transport is carried out by selecting a cell randomly from the
grid and carrying out two processes on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Saltation</strong>: A slab of sand (some fixed height of sand) is
picked up from the selected cell and deposited in another cell.
If this second cell is in the shadow, then the sand is deposited
there with a probability of 1. If it is not in the shadow but is
covered by sand, then it is deposited with a probability of 0.6,
and if the cell is not in the shadow and is bare, then it is
deposited with a probability of 0.2. If the sand is not
deposited, then the process repeats until the sand has been
deposited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avalanching</strong>: The cell where the sand was deposited is
checked to see whether any of the <strong>8</strong> (Moore neighborhood, not
the von Neumann neighborhood) immediately neighboring cells have
a sand height such that an avalanche of sand can occur from the
deposit cell to that cell. If such a cell is found, a fixed
height of sand is taken from the deposited cell and put on the
neighbor cell, simulating a slip of sand. This process is
repeated on that neighboring cell until a state is reached where
no avalanche can occur.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to this, it is to be noted that the model allows for no
erosion in the shadow, i.e. there is no saltation for the sand that is
present in the shadow.</p>
<p>This scheme was implemented in Python and C++, and the <strong>resulting dunes
had the characteristic barchan shape</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We measured the length and width of the simulated barchans (which
evolved from initial conical sand piles of different sizes) and fitted
them with a straight-line equation ($y = Ax + B$). We expected a
reasonably good fit, in line with the results from
<a href="#hersen_relevant_2002">[hersen_relevant_2002]</a>{.ref}.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thus, we can conclude that the results obtained do agree with the
expected results. Comparison with data from field studies is left to be
done.</p>
<h2 id="computational-fluid-dynamics">Computational Fluid dynamics</h2>
<p>To capture the behavior of barchans interacting with obstacles of
different shapes and sizes, it was necessary to model the flow of fluid
around these obstacles. This was done in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Solving the discretized Navier-Stokes equations for a stable
pressure-driven flow across an obstacle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the Lattice Boltzmann method to numerically simulate unstable
turbulent flow around an obstacle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pressure-driven-potential-flow">Pressure driven potential flow</h3>
<p>In some cases, fluids can be modeled using a scalar potential function
instead of a velocity field, which are related through:</p>
<p>$\overset{\rightarrow}{v} = \overset{\rightarrow}{\nabla}\varphi$</p>
<p>In 2 dimensions, the Laplace equation for the potential can be written
as usual.</p>
<p>This problem will be solved on a grid that features an airfoil-like
obstacle region. This can be done by defining boundary conditions on the
outer boundary $\Gamma_{0}$ (flow undisturbed here) and the inner
boundary $\Gamma_{i}$ (the flow does not penetrate the obstacle region).
This is written as:</p>
<p>$\overset{\rightarrow}{v}(x) \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{n}(x) = \overset{\rightarrow}{v_{0}} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{n}(x)\forall x \in \Gamma_{0}$</p>
<p>Where $\overset{\rightarrow}{v_{0}}$ is the initial velocity of the
fluid.</p>
<p>$\overset{\rightarrow}{v}(x) \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{n}(x) = 0\forall x \in \Gamma_{i}$</p>
<p>These equations are then discretized using naive finite differences and
then solved on the grid.</p>

<p>This CFD solver was integrated into the Werner model cellular automata
by altering the code such that the direction and distance of the
saltation of a particular grain were determined by the velocity vector
at that grid location.</p>
<p>Among the behaviors that were visualized using this simulation, the most
notable was the <strong>calving</strong> of the barchan dune into two dunes before
colliding with the obstacle. There was also a corresponding elongation
and asymmetry observed in the original barchan.</p>
<p>Work on the dynamics of sand collision with the obstacle is still
underway, but it was also observed that sand was captured in the wake of
the obstacle. The amount of sand captured in the wake and upwind of the
obstacle, and the reformation of barchans downwind of the obstacle (if
any) may be interesting variables to study - as information regarding
these quantities is essential to predicting the behavior of migrating
barchans that encroach on infrastructure.</p>

<p>As of now, this model can only be treated as a qualitative
representation of the dynamics of a barchan dune interacting with the
obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="lattice-boltzmann-method">Lattice Boltzmann method</h3>
<p>The Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm provides us with a method for doing
computational fluid dynamics that does not involve discretizing and
solving the Navier-Stokes equations. Instead of doing that, we think of
the fluid as a collection of molecules that exist on a grid. For each
generation of the simulation, we imagine that these particles move to
adjacent cells on the grid and that they collide with other particles.
The macroscopic properties of the fluid in each cell of the lattice
(density, velocity, etc) can then be computed from the particles that it
contains.</p>
<p>Suppose that the fluid is an ideal gas, and suppose that it has a
macroscopic velocity $\overset{\rightarrow}{u}$ and is in thermal
equilibrium at a temperature $T$. Then, the molecules will have thermal
velocities $\overset{\rightarrow}{v}$ that are distributed according to
the Boltzmann distribution. For a 2D gas, the distribution is:</p>
<p>$D\left( \overset{\rightarrow}{v} \right) = \frac{m}{2\pi kT}\exp(\frac{- m\left| \overset{\rightarrow}{v} \right|^{2}}{2kT})$</p>
<p>Where $m$ is the mass of each molecule, and $k$ is the Boltzmann
constant.</p>
<p>In the LB Method, we discretize both space and time so that only certain
velocity vectors are allowed. In this case, we use the <strong>D2Q9</strong> lattice,
in which there are only two dimensions and 9 allowed displacement
vectors - perfectly suited for the 2D cellular automata model that we
are working with.</p>
<p>Now, we attach probabilities to these nine velocity vectors, to model
the continuous Boltzmann distribution as accurately as possible. For a
fluid at rest (i.e. $\overset{\rightarrow}{u} = 0$), the previous
equation gives the most and least probable velocities with the following
probabilities or weigths $w_{i}$ for each of the nine directions:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The steps of the algorithm are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong>: All the particle number densities move into the
adjacent/diagonal lattice cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bouncing</strong>: All the particle number densities that have streamed
into a cell containing a barrier are reflected back to the direction
that they came from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collisions</strong>: From the new set of number densities contained
within each cell, we compute what densities would be if the
molecules in that cell were in thermal equilibrium. Then, we proceed
to update all the densities in the cell toward this equilibrium
state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can describe the microscopic particles that make up the fluid using
the distribution function
$f\left( \overset{\rightarrow}{x},\overset{\rightarrow}{v} \right)$
which describes the phase space density of fluids at location
$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$ traveling with velocity
$\overset{\rightarrow}{v}$</p>
<p>The streaming and the colliding behavior can be captured by the BGK
approximation (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook).</p>
<p>Where the left-hand side represents streaming and the right-hand side
approximates collisions (with time scale $\tau$). In this approximation,
the distribution function $f$ tends towards some equilibrium state
$f^{eq}$ as a result of the collisions and streaming.</p>
<p>This equation may be discretized onto the lattice. Moments of the
discrete distribution function can be taken to recover the fluid
variables at each lattice site.</p>
<p>This method was implemented in Python, and a test case scenario was run
with a cylindrical obstacle in a periodic box with rightward moving
fluid. It was expected that as the simulation evolved, turbulence would
develop in the wake of the cylinder, leading to the well-known pattern
of the <strong>Karman vortex street</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Integration of this model with the cellular automata is still underway,
and we expect to see much more complex behavior from the barchans
interacting with obstacles under the influence of this model. The
turbulence that is being modeled might be the cause of the most
interesting behavior, as it may prevent the formation of barchans or
alter their shape in the wake of the obstacle.</p>
<h3 id="global-avalanche">Global avalanching rules</h3>
<p>The avalanching rule that was specified in the original model by Werner
(<a href="#werner_eolian_1995">[werner_eolian_1995]</a>{.ref}), was seen to be
too simplistic for real sand dunes due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sand does not always immediately avalanche when the angle of repose
is reached or exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avalanches are a global phenomenon, i.e. a small avalanche or a
deposition of sand can be enough to trigger a much bigger avalanche,
which in turn can trigger even bigger avalanches. This behavior is
not captured by the previous model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To capture this behavior, we came up with a new set of rules for
avalanching:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initially, every point on the grid of sand will be evaluated to see
whether the angle or repose is exceeded concerning any of the 8
immediate neighbors. If it is exceeded, then the grid point is
assigned a <strong>probability of avalanching</strong> that is <em>proportional to
the steepness of the highest slope with its neighbors</em>. Let us call
this initial probability at the grid location $(i,j)$ as
${p^{0}}_{i,j}$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a slab of sand is deposited, it is counted as a perturbation.
The probability of avalanching in the neighborhood of the deposition
spot is increased by a value that is proportional to
$\frac{1}{d^{2}}$, where $d$ is the linear distance from the
deposition spot and the cell being updated (This is done under the
assumption that the energy from the perturbation dissipates in a
spherically symmetric fashion). If
${p^{0}}<em>{i,j} + \beta\frac{1}{d^{2}} &gt; 1$, $p</em>{new} = 1$, otherwise
$p_{new} = {p^{0}}_{i,j} + \beta\frac{1}{d^{2}}$, where $\beta$ is
some constant that measures the cooperativity of the avalanche
processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A matrix of random numbers ($x_{i,j}$) is generated with
$x_{i,j} \in \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$. If $x_{i,j} &gt; p_{i,j}$, an
avalanche is triggered there. A slab of sand is moved from that cell
to the cell which it has the steepest angle with. The probability of
avalanching at this position is set to zero. In all the positions
where this condition is not satisfied, avalanching does not occur,
and the probabilities remain the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This avalanche, in turn, is also counted as a perturbation. Similar
to the perturbation from the deposition of sand, the avalanching
probabilities in the neighborhood of the avalanching cell are
increased proportionally to $\frac{1}{d^{2}}$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The matrix of random numbers is generated again, and the process for
initiating the avalanches is repeated. This continues until either a
set upper limit of propagated avalanches (for computational cost
reasons, this had to be implemented) is reached, or there are no
more avalanches that have been initiated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This model was also incorporated into the code, and the results seemed
to show a greater realism in the case of sand avalanches as compared to
the previous model. This manifested itself in smoother slopes of
barchans, and more realistic and spread out slipface.</p>
<h1 id="additional-work">Additional work</h1>
<p>Some additional work was done regarding the barchans that do not fit
into the categories mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="self-organized-criticality-soc">Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)</h2>
<p>First introduced by
<a href="#bak_self-organized_1987">[bak_self-organized_1987]</a>{.ref}, the
concept of Self-Organized Criticality has pervaded the study of many
systems. Particularly interesting among these systems, for our study, is
the fact that Per Bak and his colleagues created a model for a sand
pile - where the avalanches on the slope of the pile followed SOC
behavior. It was shown by Sidney R. Nagel
<a href="#nagel_instabilities_1992">[nagel_instabilities_1992]</a>{.ref} that
sand piles do not demonstrate SOC behavior in real life.</p>
<p>When a pile of sand is exactly at its angle or repose, it will suffer a
lot of little landslides. A few of these landslides will become big. The
theory of critical phenomena suggests that in this situation, the
probability that a landslide grows to size $L$ should satisfy a power
law, i.e. it should be proportional to $\frac{1}{L^{c}}$ for some number
$c$ called the critical exponent. This type of behavior is seen in many
situations where the system is on the brink of some drastic change, i.e.
some critical point.</p>
<p>When the system is not at a critical point, we observe exponential laws
where the probability of a disturbance of size L is proportional to
$\exp( - \frac{L}{L_{0}})$ where $L_{0}$ is a fixed length scale. The
direct implication of this is that systems that are at a critical point
are self-similar - i.e. it has no specific length scale.</p>
<p>The idea of self-organized criticality introduced by
<a href="#bak_self-organized_1987">[bak_self-organized_1987]</a>{.ref} says that
some physical systems (like sand piles and dunes) seem to spontaneously
bring themselves towards critical points without any need for us to tune
their parameters to special values.</p>
<p>The question of whether our new global avalanching model (explained
previously) is any better concerning following SOC (or not following
SOC) was of interest to us.</p>
<p>To test how the model performed in comparison to the older model, we
sought to test the power laws that avalanches in SOC systems follow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As it can be seen, the older rule follows the power law quite closely up
until a certain cutoff size. The newer rule, on the other hand, does not
follow the SOC power law as closely and seems to have a noticeable
deviation after a certain point.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that this is because the newer rule mimics the nature of
sand avalanches more closely, i.e. there is a finite probability that an
avalanche will not happen even if the angle of slope is greater than the
angle of repose of the sand.</p>
<p>For further work on this avenue, we need to compare the results from the
new rule to the results that were obtained by
<a href="#nagel_instabilities_1992">[nagel_instabilities_1992]</a>{.ref}.</p>
<h2 id="equation-of-surface-of-the-barchan-dune">Equation of surface of the barchan dune</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Inspired by the work of
<a href="#noauthor_geometry_nodate">[noauthor_geometry_nodate]</a>{.ref}, we
sought to understand why Barchan dunes are such general structures -
they form wherever there is scarce granular matter present with a fluid
flowing over it above a certain threshold shear rate.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that some variable is being optimized in the case of the
barchan, i.e. the barchan shape is optimizing some quantity. We think
that the barchan is optimizing the trapping efficiency (that fraction of
the incoming sand flux on the barchan that is trapped in the separation
bubble) because the barchan is a self-sustaining shape that migrates
while having little to no change in its size and shape under a wide
variety of wind velocities. To confirm this, the first step would be to
understand the shape of the barchan and to quantify it precisely so that
models could be made of it and tested further.</p>
<p>Since the barchan has an asymmetric shape in a longitudinal (along the
wind) cross-section, we start with an asymmetric sinusoid
$y = a\sin\left( x - b\sin(x) \right)$.</p>
<p>Next, we know from
<a href="#sauermann_shape_2000">[sauermann_shape_2000]</a>{.ref} that the
windward and leeward feet of the barchan approximate a parabolic profile
quite closely. Integrating this fact, along with a few other tweaks, we
arrive at the equation:</p>
<p>$z = - f\left( ax^{2} + bx + c \right)\sin^{2}\left( y - x^{2} - d\sin^{2}\left( y - x^{2} \right) \right)$</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The graphs look quite similar to barchans qualitatively, but we can not
say for sure that this is the equation of the surface of the barchans
until we fit the equation with field data. This could not be done due to
the lack of time, and difficulty in finding tabulated field measurements
that could be used for this purpose.</p>
