      <description>Introduction We start off by taking as a prototype the simple Newtonian scheme of a point particle of mass $m$ moving along the x-axis under a potential field $V(x)$.&#xA;According to Newton&amp;rsquo;s Second Law of motion, $$ m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = - \frac{dV}{dx} $$&#xA;If we are given the position and the velocity of this particle at some initial time, i.e. $x(t_i)$ and $\dot{x}(t_i)$, then it is possible for us to compute the classical trajectory of the particle $x_{cl}(t)$ as follows $$ x_{cl}(t+\Delta t) = x(t_i) + \dot{x}(t_i) \Delta t $$</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my 4th semester.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in Physics (like almost everybody here). I find simulations of physical phenomena using computational methods very interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to learn more about how such methods are used in Physics. I also like bubbles! Here is work I did on them.&#xA;I love tinkering with electronics - making small (and mostly useless) circuits, burning holes in my table with a soldering iron along the way.</description>

      <description>A collection of online (and offline) resources that, in my opinion, are ideal for anyone who wishes to start tinkering. The list is continually being updated as I encounter good resources out there in the wild.&#xA;General Websites Reference for guided tutorials, theory, project ideas, and news pertinent to the hobbyist electronics community.&#xA;Electronics-Tutorial : Simple, clean tutorial site. The topics are not arranged in an ideal sequence, in my opinion, but it is still a great first reference.</description>
