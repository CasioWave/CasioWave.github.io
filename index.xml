      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in my 4th semester.
I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in Physics (like almost everybody here). I find simulations of physical phenomena using computational methods very interesting, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently trying to learn more about how such methods are used in Physics. I also like bubbles! Here is work I did on them.
I love tinkering with electronics - making small (and mostly useless) circuits, burning holes in my table with a soldering iron along the way.</description>

      <description>A collection of online (and offline) resources that, in my opinion, are ideal for anyone who wishes to start tinkering. The list is continually being updated as I encounter good resources out there in the wild.
General Websites Reference for guided tutorials, theory, project ideas, and news pertinent to the hobbyist electronics community.
Electronics-Tutorial : Simple, clean tutorial site. The topics are not arranged in an ideal sequence, in my opinion, but it is still a great first reference.</description>
