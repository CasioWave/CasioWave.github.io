[{"content":"The Ethics of Belief William K. Clifford (1877) Relevant SEP page: Ethics of Belief\n[11/01/2025] Brackets are used to express questions that arise in my mind while reading the text.\nClifford relays a story to motivate his claims: A shipowner is going to sell tickets for a transatlantic journey. He gets doubts (they are possibly presented to him, with/without evidence) that the ship is not seaworthy. The shipowner is initially unhappy but does not investigate any further and manages to acquire a “sincere and comfortable conviction” that the vessel is safe. He sells the tickets, the ship sails and then sinks, and he collects the insurance money.\nClifford claims:\nThe shipowner is guilty of the deaths of those on the ship. The shipowner may have been sincerely convinced (note: is this even possible?) of the seaworthiness of the ship, but he is still in the “wrong” (assumed to be a moral wrong) because “he had no right to believe on such evidence as was before him”. How does Clifford justify this?\nHe had not earned the belief by patient investigation of evidence. He had knowingly worked himself into the state of mind where he believed in the seaworthiness. Thus, he must be held responsible for the “wrongness” of his belief.\nClifford alters the story, imagining an outcome where the journey is completed safely. He claims that even in this case, the shipowner is in the wrong. Why?\nClifford says that action once carried out is either right or wrong forever. No outcome, good or evil, can change that. The shipowner in this case was not right, he just wasn’t found out and saved by sheer accident. In summary, Clifford believes that it does not matter if a belief turns out to be true or false, but whether the person holding said belief had a right to believe on such evidence as was before them.\nAnother story: A group of people are professing a religion that goes against some predominant religious notions on some islands. Those not part of this newer religion have a suspicion that those involved with it are using unfair and unethical (?) means to preach to children. In response, a group formed and they published grave accusations against the people involved with the new religion, without investigating their claims. A commission is formed to investigate them, and the accusations are found to be entirely false.\nClifford uses this to make the same claim as in the story before.\nHe addresses a doubt - we may say that it is not the belief that is in the wrong, but the action following upon it.\nThe shipowner may say, “I am certain that the ship is safe, but it is my duty to have her examined”. The agitators may be told, “You may be convinced of your allegations, but you ought not to have made a public attack without investigating them further”. Clifford admits that this view is right and necessary,\nWhy right? Even with fixed belief, a person always has a choice regarding any action suggested by the belief. Thus, they have the responsibility to test their convictions. Why necessary? “Those who are not yet capable of controlling their feelings and thoughts must have a plain rule dealing with overt acts”. (What does this mean? Who are the people “not capable” of said control? What “overt act”?) He points out that the view is not sufficient (clear from the fact that he calls it necessary), and that we require his previous claim (of there being no right to believe on insufficient evidence) to supplement this view. He claims that,\nIt is not possible to sever the belief from the action it suggests. Thus, we can not condemn one without condemning the other. Why? He reasons that a person who believes in (or, is even inclined towards) one side of an argument/question may never be able to investigate it with the fairness and completeness of someone who has no such bias. (Is it true that our biases are always stronger than our belief in the process of proper investigation?) He goes ahead and makes a stronger claim: A belief that does not have any influence on the actions of the person who holds it is not a true belief. (Then what is a belief that does not inspire action? Say, I have a belief that includes that clause that says if I ever act in a way that lets others know of said belief, I would be committing a wrong deed. Is such a thought not a belief for Clifford, or is he contesting that such a thought simply can not exist?) He claims that,\nAny person who has ever wanted to commit an action inspired by some belief has “already committed it in his heart”. (How can committing something “in the heart” equivalent in anyway to real action?) If a belief is not immediately causing a real action, it is “stored away” to influence future actions - it goes into some part of our minds, made up of an aggregate of beliefs, that is the link between sensation and action at all moments of our lives (So, are all of our actions motivated by a belief or some remnant of it? Are there no actions not motivated by beliefs?) Further, he claims that this “aggregate” can not be separated into the constituent beliefs, and each new belief inducted into it changes its structure. So, every belief (true belief, as he defines it) is linked to some action, ultimately. Not only that, but each belief opens us up to more similar beliefs. As a result, Clifford argues that no person may have something akin to a “private belief”. This, combined with the claim that humans live in societies where we have shared, common heritage, leads him to draw the conclusion that any belief (no matter how trivial) has far reaching consequences. So, he extends his judgement to all beliefs held by all sorts of people, and claims that individuals have to earn their beliefs by examination because they hold these beliefs for all of humanity.\nHe acknowledges that the burden of such thorough examination of ourr beliefs is a heavy one, and reasons that this is not only because of the difficulty in carrying out such examination but also because we feel safe and secure in holding a fixed belief whereas doubting it makes us bare and powerless. This sense of power attached to believing is what makes people desirous of believing, and afraid of doubting. He argues that we should earn said power through our examination of evidence instead of resorting to a fake sense of power - as justified belief enriches not just the individual holding the belief but also mankind as a whole. Additionally, he claims that unjustified belief not only runs the risk (or, in his view the certainty) of wrong action, but it also encourages others to belief without justification. This perpetuates the problems of unjustified belief. On the other hand, a person who seeks evidence for or against his belief inspires a similar spirit of inquiry in others, thereby making mankind more virtuous. Thus, he states his principle - It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence. He proceeds next to make an every stronger statement, saying that once inquiry has been completed to the greatest extent possible and a belief accepted, it is still the duty of every person holding a belief to continue to be open to evidence for or against the belief. (Is he not ccontradicting himself? If the belief is accepted as justified at some point in time, is the person holding the belief not “biased” as he puts it before - and thereby incapable of a fair assessment of further evidence? So, does belief-acceptance bar a person from belief-relinquishment?) He finishes the section by saying that a person who does not have the time for such inquiry should not have the time to believe.\n","permalink":"https://casiowave.github.io/interests/philosophy/the-ethics-of-belief/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-ethics-of-belief\"\u003eThe Ethics of Belief\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"william-k-clifford-1877\"\u003eWilliam K.

An equivalent way to doing the same thing is to specify an initial point $(x_i,t_i)$ and a final point $(x_f,t_f)$ (Why?).\nIn the Lagrangian formalism, the same problem is posed in this way: Given the initial and the final point, what is it that distinguishes the actual classical trajectory joining these point from the infinite other trajectories that join these two points? The answer to this lies in the following points:\nDefine a function $\\mathbf{L}$, called the Lagrangian which is given by, $$ \\mathbf{L} = T - V $$ $T$ and $V$ being the kinetic and potential energies of the particle. Thus, $\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{L}(x,\\dot{x})$. Note that we assume the absence of $t$ dependence by considering a potential field that is not time-dependent.\nFor each path $x(t)$ connecting $(x_i,t_i)$ and $(x_f,t_f)$, calculate the action, defined by, $$ S[x(t)] = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\mathbf{L}(x,\\dot{x}) dt $$ There are square brackets because we want to remember that the argument of S is the entire path or the entire function $x(t)$, not just the value of the function at some time. $S$ is thus also called a functional.\nPrinciple of Least Action: The classical path is the one on which $S$ is a minimum (Actually, it is only required that it be an extremum. The name is merely customary).\nNow, we verify whether this principle gives us back Newton\u0026rsquo;s Second Law.\nA multivariable detour Since $S$ is a function of some other function $x(t)$, it is really just a multivariable function of $n$ variables as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$. This is due to the fact that the function $x(t)$ actually specifies an infinite number of values $x(t_i), \\dots , x(t) , \\dots , x(t_f)$ - one for each instant in time $t$ in the specified interval. We will deal with the entire minimum (actually, extremum) situation of the action by generalising how we deal with it in n variables. Let us define a function, $$ f = f(x_1, \\dots , x_n) = f(\\vec{x}) $$ The minimum of this function, say, $\\vec{x^0}$ is characterised by the fact that if we move away from it by a small amount $\\vec{\\eta}$ in any direction, the first order change in $f$ vanishes. Using the Taylor expansion, $$ f(\\vec{x^0}+\\vec{\\eta}) = f(\\vec{x^0}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\bigg\\rvert_{\\vec{x^0}} \\eta_i + \\text{ higher order terms in } \\eta $$ then, we get, $$ \\delta f^{(1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\bigg\\rvert_{\\vec{x^0}} \\eta_i = 0 $$ as the first order change vanishes. From this, we can see that if we choose $\\vec{\\eta}$ such that it is along the ith direction, every first order partial derivative of the function vanishes at $\\vec{x^0}$. $$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\bigg\\rvert_{\\vec{x^0}} = 0 \\quad , i = 1,\\dots , n $$\nComing back to the action We now use the property that we deduced to arrive at the extremum of $S$. We assume that $x_{cl}(t)$ is the path of least action (as per the principle), and that $x_{cl}(t) + \\eta(t)$ is a \u0026ldquo;nearby\u0026rdquo; path. As all the paths have to coincide at the initial and the final points, we get the condition, $$ \\eta(t_i) = \\eta(t_f) = 0 $$ So now we get to the main attraction, $$ S[x_{cl}(t) + \\eta(t)] = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\mathbf{L} (x_{cl}(t) + \\eta(t),\\dot{x}_{cl}(t) + \\dot{\\eta}(t)) dt $$\nNow, expanding the Lagrangian to its Taylor series expression,\n$$ \\Rightarrow S[x_{cl}(t) + \\eta(t)] = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} \\bigg[ \\mathbf{L} ( x_{cl}(t), \\dot{x}_{cl}(t) ) + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial x(t)} \\bigg \\vert _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\eta(t) + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg \\vert _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\dot{\\eta}(t) + \\cdots \\bigg] dt $$\n$$ \\Rightarrow S[x_{cl}(t) + \\eta(t)] = S[x_{cl}(t)] + \\delta S^{(1)} + \\text{ higher order terms } $$ Since this is the case with infinite variables, the sum involving the first order partial derivatives of the action has been converted into an integral. Using the fact that we deduced earlier regarding the first order change going to zero, we can say, $$ 0 = \\delta S^{(1)} = \\bigg[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial x(t)} \\bigg \\vert _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\eta(t) + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg \\vert _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\dot{\\eta}(t) \\bigg] dt $$ If we integrate the second term by parts with the partial derivative as the first function and the $\\dot{\\eta}$ term as the second function (Why? It has $\\dot{\\eta}(t)$, and we know that $\\eta$ cancels out at the ends) we get: $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg \\vert _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\eta(t) \\bigg \\vert _{t_i}^{t_f} - \\int _{t_i} ^{t_f} \\bigg[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg] _{x _{cl} } \\cdot \\eta(t) dt $$ As mentioned before, the first term here vanishes. So, we get: $$ 0 = \\delta S^{(1)} = \\int _{t_i} ^{t_f} \\bigg[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial x(t)} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg] _{ x _{cl} } \\cdot \\eta(t) dt $$ Here, the integral and the stuff inside the bracket acts like the infinite analogue of the sum of all the first order partial derivatives of the multivariable function, i.e. the discrete variable $\\eta$ is replaced by $\\eta(t)$, the sum over $i$ is replaced by the integral over \u0026amp;t\u0026amp;, and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}$ is replaced by $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial x(t)} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)}$. Since $\\eta(t)$ is arbitrary, we may extract the analogue of the finite case: $$ \\bigg[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial x(t)} - \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}(t)} \\bigg] _{x _{cl} (t) } = 0 \\quad \\text{ for } t_i \\leq t \\leq t_f $$ This is the famous Euler Lagrange equation.\nDoes this give back NLM?

The list is continually being updated as I encounter good resources out there in the wild.\nGeneral Websites Reference for guided tutorials, theory, project ideas, and news pertinent to the hobbyist electronics community.\nElectronics-Tutorial : Simple, clean tutorial site. The topics are not arranged in an ideal sequence, in my opinion, but it is still a great first reference.\nSparkfun Learn : A pretty exhaustive list of tutorials (and in general, information) regarding the myriad modules you can get for the Arduino ecosystem.\nAll About Circuits : Framed like a textbook (technically, it is one), it is an excellent learning resource for beginners. Their blog is pretty technical, but you can find useful/interesting stuff on it.\nelectronicstheory.com : A very old, and respected, site on electronics theory up to an intermediate level.\nInstructables : Always a good source for project ideas.\nEEVblog : Best blog out there for all things EE.\nElectrical4U : Informative articles.\nArduino Docs : Something you should have in your bookmarks if you work with Arduinos. Well written, and concise.\nCommunities Communities are a great way to get involved with electronics as a hobby.\n/r/AskElectronics : For those of you out there who are familiar with Reddit, r/AskElectronics is a very good community to get started in.\nElectronics StackExchange : Ask questions here, if Reddit is not your thing (and I don\u0026rsquo;t blame you if it isn\u0026rsquo;t).\nVideo Resources GreatScott\u0026rsquo;s Electronic Basics Playlist : If video tutorials are your thing, GreatScott\u0026rsquo;s Electronic Basics is an excellent place to start. You might want to check out his YT Channel in general, it has great stuff.\nAfrotechmods : Though he hasn\u0026rsquo;t put out any new videos/blog posts in over 5 years, Afrotechmods\u0026rsquo; YT channel and website remain excellent references.\nBooks You\u0026rsquo;ll find me hoarding these books at the Library most of the time, but I\u0026rsquo;m willing to share.\nThe Art of Electronics - Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill: Highly recommended read. Our library has a copy, here.\nElectronic Principles - Albert Paul Malvino, David J. Bates: Standard textbook on all things electronics - and for good reason. Library copy here.\nDigital Computer Electronics - Albert Paul Malvino, Jerald A. Brown: Library copy here.\nPractical Electronics Handbook - Ian R. Sinclair, John Dunton: The library has a copy, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to track it down yet :(\nElectronics: A Physical Approach - David W. Snoke: Excellent read, also highly recommended.\nArduino specific If you ask me, the best way to start is to just get yourself and Arduino kit, go on Instructables, decide on some project (doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it looks complicated, it just needs to interest you) and, well, just start. In my experience, you always learn this stuff faster if you build it yourself instead of just reading the theory.\nMore to come! I\u0026rsquo;ll be adding websites, YT channels, books, and other resources as I come across them. Feel free to contact me with any suggestions! Looking forward to an active hobbyist electronics community on campus :)\n","permalink":"https://casiowave.github.io/interests/electronics/get-started/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/interests/electronics/get-started/images/get-started.gif\" type=\"\" alt=\"get-started\"  /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA collection of online (and offline) resources that, in my opinion, are ideal for anyone who wishes to start tinkering.
